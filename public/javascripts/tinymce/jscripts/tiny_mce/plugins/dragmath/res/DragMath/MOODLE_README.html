Integration:</b></span></p>

<P>PLEASE read the documentation at Moodle.org on using DragMath before installing.  
The documentation can be found at: <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/DragMath_equation_editor" 
target="_blank">http://docs.moodle.org/en/DragMath_equation_editor</a>. 
The zip archive for installing DragMath with Moodle integration can be downloaded  
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dragmath/files/DragMath/0.7.8.2/Moodle_DragMath_v0.7.8.2_Integration.zip/download">by clicking here</a>

<p>In order to make DragMath installation for Moodle users as simple as
possible, the DragMath package (see <a
href="README.html"><b>README.html</b></a> has been integrated with Moodle and
a zip created so that the user can simply place the new zip in their Moodle
root and unzip (no file shifting necessary). To accomodate this installation
method a replacement for the file adminlib.php is not provided, though
/lib/adminlib_exampleonly.php has been provided so that you can compare this
version to your own version so as to make the quick line change in your own
adinlib.php to allow you to hide the dragmath icon (by adding the icon to the
adminlib.php icon array for the GUI.</p>

<p>The package include some changes, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moving the DragMath directory to /lib/DragMath - it was thought that
    with changes to the actual DragMath infrastructure, leaving DragMath in
    its previous location might result in more confusion that start9ing
    afresh, and /lib/DragMath is the location where DragMath will be found in
    Moodle 2.</li>
  <li>Adding a language variable in dlg_ins_dragmath.php so that DragMath
    will, to the extent of its own language files, use the same language as
    set in Moodle.</li>
  <li>Change the reference to codebase in the applet in dlg_ins_dragmath.php
    so that it is relative to Moodle root and can be changed to pass
    different locations</li>
  <li>Employing the new Moodle DragMath icon presently adopted for Moodle 2
    (the old icon is still present, and you need only change file names in
    the /lib/editor/htmlarea/images directory to revert.</li>
  <li>And, of course, addressing all the changes made to DragMath by its
    authors</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the zip created will install on unzip, this file is located in the
DragMath directory so that /lib is not populated with install READMEs. Once
installed, you should be able to update to future version of DragMath simply
by replacing the current /lib/DragMath with the DragMath folder available on
sourceforge; the integration will not change.</p>

<p>The integration files are located in /lib/editor/htmlarea/ and include a
replacement dialog.js, a replacement htmlarea.php, a new
popups/dlg_ins_dragmath.php, and three icons in images/. Only
dlg_ins_dragmath.php has been altered for this version.</p>

<p>Credit for making the integration possible goes of course to Chris, Alex
and the DragMath folks as well as to Mauno Korpelainen</p>
<address>
  NB: There has been discussion that a line in dialog.js has produced some
  problems in Moodle version 1.9.5+ (the editor disappears) and that by
  deleting the line that adds the dragmath icon the problem is resolved. This
  may be an artifact of the impact of the icon sizing, so if you discover
  such a situation please post at once to the Math Tools forum on Moodle.org
  so that the situation can be fully documented and resolved.
